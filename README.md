# Kentrin

**A constitutional base-layer monetary standard.**

Kentrin is not a token.\
It is not a meme coin.\
It is not a speculative instrument.

Kentrin is a mathematically defined issuance protocol designed to
function as a deterministic monetary base layer.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Core Principles

### 1. Deterministic Issuance

Supply follows a predefined emission curve.\
No governance votes.\
No discretionary minting.\
No political expansion.

### 2. Constitutional Structure

The monetary policy is encoded as a constitution --- not subject to
casual modification.

### 3. Federated Clearing Architecture

Kentrin separates issuance from transaction-layer implementations.\
Independent nodes may track, settle, and clear value using publicly
verifiable serial standards.

### 4. Human-Readable Units

Public serial identifiers are simple and auditable.\
Private keys remain cryptographically secure and isolated.

## What Kentrin Is Not

-   Not a DeFi yield engine\
-   Not a governance token\
-   Not a staking rewards system\
-   Not a pump-and-dump vehicle

Kentrin is infrastructure.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Why Kentrin Exists

Modern monetary systems are discretionary.\
Most crypto systems are inflationary, speculative, or governance-driven.

Kentrin proposes an alternative:

A monetary base layer defined by mathematics --- not committees.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Status

Early-stage constitutional design and specification drafting.

The first milestone is finalizing the emission curve and serial
standard.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Roadmap (Phase 1)

-   [ ] Define emission curve mathematically\
-   [ ] Draft constitutional monetary document\
-   [ ] Design serial identifier format\
-   [ ] Define node verification model\
-   [ ] Publish reference implementation
